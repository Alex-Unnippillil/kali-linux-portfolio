# kali-linux-portfolio â€” agents.me

## Overview
This file summarizes the guidance for automated contributors working in this repository. It mirrors the canonical instructions from `AGENTS.md` so tooling that reads `.me` manifests can still load the same expectations.

## Key points
- The portfolio emulates a Kali/Ubuntu desktop and all security tooling must remain **simulation only**.
- Use Node.js version from `.nvmrc`, install dependencies with Yarn, and prefer feature flags over hardcoded secrets.
- Run quality gates (`yarn lint`, `yarn test`, optional smoke/E2E suites) before committing changes.
- Respect the Next.js architecture: keep React components functional, co-locate assets, and centralize window state logic.
- Analytics, PWA behavior, and accessibility must not regress; treat API-backed features as demo-friendly when offline.
