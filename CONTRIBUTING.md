# Contributing Guide

Thanks for helping improve the Kali Linux Portfolio! This document highlights the review process so changes land smoothly.

## Review expectations

- **CODEOWNERS coverage.** Pull requests touching `/apps`, `/components`, `/lib`, or `/configs` will automatically request a review from the listed owners. Make sure those reviewers sign off before merging.
- **Coordinate early.** If a change spans multiple areas or needs a different subject matter expert, @-mention the relevant owner in the PR description so they can reroute as needed.
- **Provide context.** Include a short summary of the problem you are solving, screenshots for UI updates, and the test commands you executed (see `AGENTS.md` for the full checklist).
- **Keep changes scoped.** Smaller, focused commits help owners review faster. Large refactors should be pre-discussed so maintainers can plan enough review time.
- **Confirm ownership.** Share the CODEOWNERS assignments with the maintainers for confirmation and update the file whenever team responsibilities change or new owners join.

If you are unsure who should review your contribution, start a discussion in the issue or pull request and tag @Alex-Unnippillil. They can confirm or reassign the correct owner.
