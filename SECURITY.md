# Security Policy

This project delivers educational simulations of offensive tooling. While the apps only ship canned data, we still take potential vulnerabilities seriously.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue, please open a private advisory at [github.com/Alex-Unnippillil/kali-linux-portfolio/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/Alex-Unnippillil/kali-linux-portfolio/security/advisories/new). Avoid filing public issues until we have coordinated on a fix.
