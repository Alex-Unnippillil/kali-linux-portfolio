/*
Overlay usage notes
====================
- Use the helpers in `utils/scrollLock` to keep the page from jumping when an overlay (modal, sheet, notification flyout, etc.) opens.
- Call `lockScroll()` when the overlay mounts or becomes visible and `unlockScroll()` in the cleanup handler when it closes.
- The helper compensates for scrollbar width so layout stays stable even on pages with vertical scrollbars.
- Helpers are reference-counted which means multiple overlays can be open simultaneously without fighting for scroll state.
- Future overlay components should wire these helpers via `useEffect` or their mounting lifecycle so the behaviour stays consistent across the desktop shell.
