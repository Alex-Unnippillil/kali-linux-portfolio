# Wireshark Sample Captures

The sample capture files in this directory are sourced from the official Wireshark repository:

- [http.cap](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/raw/master/test/captures/http.cap)
- [dns.cap](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/raw/master/test/captures/dns.cap)

These files are provided for testing and educational purposes.

The lab fixtures bundled with the Wireshark simulator derive their packet
metadata from these captures. Payloads were trimmed and sanitised to keep the
demo lightweight while preserving headers that highlight protocol behaviour.
