# Terminal Help

This terminal emulates basic shell commands. Type commands and press Enter to execute.

- Use arrow keys to navigate history.
- Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel a running command.
- The `help` command lists available commands.

## Multi-line paste safety

- Pasting more than one line triggers a review banner that lists the number of commands and shows a preview with line numbers.
- Choose **Run all** to execute the entire snippet, or **Run line by line** to step through each command with a live progress indicator.
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** while the banner is visible to approve the paste without clicking.
- Select **Trust _origin_ for the next paste only** to skip the next warning from that site. The trust record is stored per origin and consumed after one bypass.
- The banner can be dismissed with **Cancel** or the `Esc` key if the paste was accidental.
