# Files Help

The Files app lets you browse folders stored in the browser sandbox (OPFS) or in a directory you pick with the native picker.

- Use the breadcrumb trail to jump back up the folder hierarchy.
- Press **Enter** or **Space** on a focused item to open it.
- Open the context menu with a right click or by pressing **Shift+F10** when an item is focused.
- Choose **Open in Terminal** to launch the Terminal app with the working directory set to the selected folder. For files, the terminal opens in their containing directory.
- Use the search box at the bottom of the window to find text inside files in the current folder.
