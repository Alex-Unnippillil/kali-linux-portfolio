# Window stacks and groups

The desktop now supports organizing windows into named stacks. Use the toolbar controls at the top of the desktop window area to
create groups, rename them, or dissolve them when you are finished.

## Creating a group

1. Drag any window card onto another window to stack them together.
2. Alternatively, drag a window into the "Drop here for new group" target in the toolbar and give the stack a name.
3. Use the **New Group** button to create an empty stack first, then drag windows into it.

Each group shows its member icons in the toolbar. Dragging a window onto a group adds it to that stack while preserving the order
of existing members.

## Renaming or reordering groups

* Drag group chips left or right to reorder the toolbar.
* Use the pencil button on a group chip to rename it. The change is stored with the workspace, so switching away and back keeps
your custom labels.

## Dissolving a group

* Select the trash icon on a group chip. The windows stay open and revert to solo mode.
* You can also drop a grouped window on the "Drop to ungroup" target to pull it out without deleting the entire stack.

## Workspace awareness

Window stacks are stored per workspace. When you switch between workspaces, each one restores the stack membership, order, and
last-known window positions.
