# Test Log

## pages/apps routes console error check

Attempted to load each route under `/apps` in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. All requests returned HTTP 500 responses, so console errors could not be verified.

## Serverful and Static modes (2025-02-13)

- `yarn build` failed: Module not found: Can't resolve '../../ui/FormError' in `components/apps/serial-terminal.tsx`.
- `yarn export` now uses `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js` to generate a static build.
- `yarn test` reported failing tests: `hashcat.test.tsx`, `beef.test.tsx`, `mimikatz.test.ts`.

## bare-fs warning (2025-08-29)

- `yarn why bare-fs` shows the module is required by `tar-fs@3.1.0` via `@puppeteer/browsers@2.10.7`.
- Latest versions (`@puppeteer/browsers@2.10.8`, `tar-fs@3.1.0`) still depend on `bare-fs@4.2.1`, so the warning remains.
- `puppeteer` and `puppeteer-core` require this chain; removing them would break existing tooling, so the warning is ignored.

## Headless screenshot compatibility (2025-09-29)

- Development middleware now appends `'unsafe-eval'` to `script-src` when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` so the Next.js dev bundle can run inside headless browsers (e.g., Playwright) and capture screenshots.
- Removed the manual note that explained screenshots were unavailable due to the stricter dev CSP; the automation workaround is no longer needed.

## Keyboard focus audit (2025-10-31)

- Toggled the desktop between default, dark, and neon themes and used keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab) to traverse the dock, global menu trigger, category list, and app results. Focus rings track the accent color for each theme and remain visible against the surrounding chrome.
- Verified the window controls (pin, minimize, maximize/restore, close) expose the shared focus ring token and remain reachable while the title bar is focused.
- Confirmed Whisker menu list items and Places/Applications menu entries inherit the same focus treatment without regressing pointer interactions.
