# Forensics Sample Files

To try the Prefetch JumpList tool, sample artifacts can be downloaded from the
[dtformats test data](https://github.com/libyal/dtformats/tree/master/test_data).

Useful locations:

- [Prefetch samples](https://github.com/libyal/dtformats/tree/master/test_data/Prefetch)
- [JumpList samples](https://github.com/libyal/dtformats/tree/master/test_data/JumpList)

Download one of those files and load it into the app to see the timeline.
