Use this checklist to verify basic interactions in the portfolio before release.

## Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Tab order flows through all interactive elements without traps.
- [ ] Arrow keys or documented shortcuts respond as expected.
- [ ] Focus indicators remain visible at all times.

## Enter key submission
- [ ] Pressing **Enter** submits forms or activates the primary action.
- [ ] Dialogs and modals can be dismissed or confirmed with **Enter**.

## Responsive layout
- [ ] Adjust viewport from mobile to desktop sizes; layout adapts without overlap.
- [ ] Windows, menus, and controls remain usable on small screens.

## Cookie verification
- [ ] Accepting the banner stores the expected cookie.
- [ ] The banner stays hidden on subsequent loads until cookies are cleared.

## Extra tests
- [ ] Open the site in a private window to catch caching or storage dependencies.
- [ ] Disable JavaScript to ensure the page presents a readable fallback or notice.
