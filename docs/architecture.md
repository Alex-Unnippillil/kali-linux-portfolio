# Architecture

The project is a desktop-style portfolio built with Next.js.

- **pages/** wraps applications using Next.js routing and dynamic imports.
- **components/apps/** contains the individual app implementations.
- **utils/privacyRegistry.ts** tracks simulated permission grants used by the Privacy Dashboard and security lab demos.
- **pages/api/** exposes serverless functions for backend features.

For setup instructions, see the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) guide.
