# Accessibility Checklist

## Landmark Audit (2025-09-29)
- [x] Confirmed the desktop workspace uses a single `<main>` landmark with an `aria-label` for rotor discovery.
- [x] Labeled the desktop navigation bar for assistive technologies.
- [x] Labeled the taskbar toolbar to clarify its purpose when navigating landmarks or rotor listings.
- [x] Converted the window area into a named region so skip links and rotor navigation land on an announced target without duplicate `main` landmarks.
