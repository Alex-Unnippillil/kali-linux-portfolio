# Deauthentication Attack Mitigation

Deauthentication floods send forged management frames to disconnect wireless clients. Use the following hardening steps:

- [ ] Enable **802.11w Management Frame Protection** so that deauth frames are authenticated.
- [ ] Monitor for excessive deauthentication traffic and alert on anomalies.
- [ ] Use strong encryption (WPA2/WPA3) and rotate keys regularly.
- [ ] Limit access-point exposure and segment networks.
