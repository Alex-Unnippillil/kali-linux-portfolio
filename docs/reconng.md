# Recon-ng Simulation

> ⚠️ For educational use in authorized lab environments only.

## Module Schemas

Modules are defined in `components/apps/reconng/index.js` as schema objects with:

- `input` – expected target type (`domain` or `ip`).
- `demo(target)` – returns canned text, nodes and edges for offline runs.
- `fetchUrl(target)` – optional CORS-friendly endpoint used when **Live fetch** is enabled.

## Offline Demonstration

Static fixtures in `public/reconng-marketplace.json` and `public/reconng-chain.json` supply marketplace modules and example chains. Module runs default to the schema's `demo` output so the simulation works without network access.

## Opt-in Network Requests

Checking the **Live fetch** box sends a limited request to the schema's `fetchUrl`. If the request succeeds, its text replaces the demo output. If it fails, the demo data is shown instead. Remote responses are not stored and the graph remains the example data.

## Data Storage

 - Per-module API keys are persisted in `localStorage` under the key `reconng-api-keys` and inputs are masked by default.
- Workspace graphs and entity sets exist only in memory but can be exported as CSV or JSON.
- Static marketplace and chain data live in the `public/` directory.
