# Accessibility Guidelines

This project includes a collection of games and utilities. To ensure all users can interact with these experiences, follow these accessibility practices:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive canvases are focusable and expose an accessible name. When adding new games, ensure canvases receive `tabIndex="0"` and a descriptive `aria-label`.
- **ARIA Live Regions**: Dynamic score or status text should be placed inside containers with `aria-live="polite"` so screen readers announce updates without disrupting gameplay.
- **Color Alternatives**: Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning. Use the provided `.status-success`, `.status-warning`, and `.status-error` classes in `styles/index.css` which include pattern fills in addition to color.
- **Testing**: Run `yarn test` to execute automated accessibility checks powered by `axe-core`.

Following these guidelines will help keep new contributions inclusive and usable for everyone.
