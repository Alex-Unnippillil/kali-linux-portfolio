# Accessibility checks

The project ships an automated accessibility scan that exercises the desktop shell across key routes. Run it locally after starting a production server (for example, `yarn build && yarn start`) or by exporting a `BASE_URL` that points to a running instance.

```bash
yarn a11y
```

This command reads [`pa11yci.json`](../pa11yci.json) and runs Pa11y with the Axe runner against:

- `/` (desktop shell)
- `/apps` (application catalog)
- `/apps/settings`
- `/apps/project-gallery`
- `/apps/nmap-nse`

Each route is scanned in default theme, high-contrast mode, and with the notifications panel opened to ensure interactive affordances remain accessible.

## Waivers

No accessibility waivers are currently in place. If a violation must be deferred, document the impacted selector, the reason, and a target fix milestone here.
