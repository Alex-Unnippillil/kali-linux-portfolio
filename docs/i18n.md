# Internationalization

Locale files live under `locales/` and contain translations in JSON format. A placeholder checker validates these files to prevent runtime issues and unsafe interpolation.

## Placeholder rules

- Use named placeholders wrapped in double curly braces, e.g. `{{user}}`.
- Positional placeholders such as `%s` or numeric tokens like `{{0}}` are rejected.
- Empty placeholders (`{{}}`) and mismatched braces are also reported.
- `%{name}` and placeholders with extra spaces (`{{ name }}`) are automatically converted to the safe `{{name}}` form when the checker runs with `--fix`.

## Running the checker

The validation runs as part of the standard lint script:

```bash
yarn lint
```

It can also be executed independently or with autofix:

```bash
yarn lint:locales        # validate locale files
yarn lint:locales --fix  # apply safe placeholder fixes
```

Any reported issues cause the command to exit with a non-zero status, blocking CI.
