# 2048 Controls & Tips

The 2048 tile puzzle now shares the standardized game toolbar used across the desktop arcade apps. Use this page as a quick reference for keyboard shortcuts and persistent features.

## Core Controls

- **Arrow keys** – slide all tiles in the chosen direction.
- **Pause / Resume** – press **P** or use the toolbar toggle when you need a break.
- **Reset** – hit **R** or the toolbar reset button to start over with a fresh grid.
- **Undo** – press **U** or **Backspace**, or click the toolbar button. Up to five previous moves are available when playing inside the desktop shell.
- **Sound toggle** – tap **M** or the toolbar button to mute/unmute the merge chime.

## Additional Options

- **Hard mode** – spawns two tiles per move and introduces a three-second timer. The timer pauses automatically whenever the game is paused.
- **Board skin** – switch between Classic (decimal) and Hex output when playing the standalone `/apps/2048` route.
- **High score tracking** – the toolbar exposes the current score and the highest score stored in local storage under the shared `highscore:2048` key.

## Persistence

- Grid state, score, and options persist between sessions. Use the reset button or keyboard shortcut if you want to wipe the board manually.
- Undo history and replay exports remain local to the browser; no network requests fire unless you opt into the leaderboard submission on win/loss.

> The toolbar and shortcut set are shared with other puzzle and arcade titles. Aligning the UX and local storage high score keys simplifies testing and documentation across the catalog.
