# Nmap NSE Walkthrough (Simulation)

> ⚠️ For educational use in authorized lab environments only.

This guide shows how an Nmap scan using the default vulnerability scripts might appear and lists defensive steps to mitigate such reconnaissance.

## Example Command

```bash copy
nmap -sV --script vuln 10.0.0.5
```

- `-sV` enables service and version detection.
- `--script vuln` runs safe vulnerability check scripts bundled with Nmap.

## Static Example Output

```text copy
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.52
443/tcp closed https
```

This output is a canned sample; the simulation never contacts a real host.

## Defensive Measures

- Restrict inbound traffic using firewalls and disable unused ports.
- Monitor logs for repeated scans or NSE script fingerprints.
- Patch exposed services so known vulnerabilities are not present.
