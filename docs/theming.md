# Theming

## Watermarks

Use the `.dragon-watermark` utility to place a subtle dragon image behind content.

```html
<h1 class="dragon-watermark">Dragon Heading</h1>
```

## Heading Contrast

Watermarks and other decorative backgrounds must not reduce text readability.
Headings should retain sufficient contrast against the background:
- 4.5:1 ratio for normal text
- 3:1 ratio for large headings (â‰¥24px or bold 19px)

Adjust the foreground color if the watermark lowers contrast below these guidelines.
