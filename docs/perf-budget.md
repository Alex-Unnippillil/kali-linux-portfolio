# Performance Budgets

Define critical performance budgets for key routes. Metrics are in milliseconds unless noted.

| Route | LCP (ms) | FID (ms) | CLS |
|-------|---------|---------|-----|
| / | 2500 | 100 | 0.1 |
| /about | 2500 | 100 | 0.1 |
| /games | 3000 | 100 | 0.1 |
| /scanner | 3000 | 100 | 0.1 |

Budgets serve as thresholds for automated alerts.
