# Project Task Backlog

The following numbered backlog captures incremental improvements and investigations for the Kali Linux Portfolio experience.

1. Audit the desktop window manager to ensure focus handling works consistently with keyboard navigation and screen readers.
2. Refactor the dock component to lazy-load icons and reduce initial bundle size without regressing hover previews.
3. Implement a global theming toggle that lets users switch between light, dark, and high-contrast variants of the desktop skin.
4. Add persistent window layout saving so reopened sessions restore window positions and sizes using local storage.
5. Improve drag-and-drop performance on touch devices by debouncing pointer events and adding tactile feedback animations.
6. Create a contextual help overlay that explains the desktop controls and can be summoned with a keyboard shortcut.
7. Expand the right-click context menu with shortcuts for "Open in New Window" and "Add to Favorites" actions.
8. Build a notification center widget that aggregates simulated system alerts and recent activity logs.
9. Optimize the background wallpaper loader to support responsive sources and blur-up placeholders.
10. Add multi-monitor simulation by allowing the desktop canvas to pan across an extended virtual workspace.
11. Update the terminal app simulation with additional canned commands that teach common Kali Linux workflows.
12. Enhance the file explorer app with sortable table columns and breadcrumb navigation for nested directories.
13. Introduce a package manager simulation that lists curated security tools with descriptions and mock install logs.
14. Build a clipboard manager utility app showing recent copied snippets and allowing pinned entries.
15. Add a screenshot tool that captures the current desktop state and downloads an image locally.
16. Create a process monitor simulation visualizing CPU, memory, and network graphs sourced from mock data.
17. Implement a task scheduler UI that lets users configure reminders and timed demo tasks within the desktop.
18. Expand the retro game catalog with a pixel-art puzzle game that teaches cybersecurity concepts.
19. Update the music player app with playlist support and waveform visualizations using client-side audio APIs.
20. Add a markdown notes app featuring syntax highlighting, export options, and simulated collaborative editing.
21. Write an interactive tutorial that guides newcomers through launching, resizing, and closing desktop apps.
22. Produce a walkthrough for configuring the simulated VPN app, highlighting best practices without real network calls.
23. Create an in-app changelog viewer that surfaces recent release notes pulled from the repo's data directory.
24. Design a security awareness quiz app with randomized questions and shareable results.
25. Build a phishing email analyzer simulation that teaches users how to spot malicious indicators in sample messages.
26. Add a "Red Team vs Blue Team" scenario selector that launches curated sets of simulated tools and logs.
27. Implement a vulnerability management dashboard with mock CVE feeds and prioritization filters.
28. Create a forensics lab simulation where users inspect disk images through guided steps and canned evidence.
29. Develop a wireless auditing tutorial that explains terminology and shows simulated scan outputs.
30. Add a password cracking workshop that visualizes entropy, cracking speeds, and defense strategies without real attacks.
31. Perform an accessibility audit of all interactive components and document fixes in an actionable checklist.
32. Add focus-visible styling to every desktop control to improve navigation clarity for keyboard users.
33. Implement reduced-motion preferences that disable non-essential animations when the OS setting is detected.
34. Ensure high-contrast themes meet WCAG color contrast ratios across window chrome and content areas.
35. Localize core UI strings into at least two additional languages with a language switcher accessible from the dock.
36. Provide RTL layout support for applicable languages by adjusting desktop alignment and window chrome.
37. Optimize bundle splitting to isolate rarely used apps from the primary desktop shell chunk.
38. Replace large raster assets with vector or responsive alternatives to improve Lighthouse performance scores.
39. Instrument performance markers around window creation and report metrics to the analytics wrapper when enabled.
40. Implement service worker caching strategies tailored for app shell assets versus dynamic data JSON files.
41. Expand unit test coverage for window management reducers and ensure edge cases are captured.
42. Add integration tests that verify app launch sequences, focus transitions, and dock pinning behaviors.
43. Configure automated visual regression tests for key desktop states using Playwright and percy-like snapshots.
44. Create smoke test scripts that crawl every `/apps/*` route and validate essential elements render in static export.
45. Set up Git hooks that run linting and unit tests on staged files to prevent regressions entering the repo.
46. Document the process for generating mock data so contributors can extend simulations without live services.
47. Draft contributor guidelines that highlight coding conventions, testing requirements, and review expectations.
48. Build a status dashboard page summarizing test coverage, bundle sizes, and recent deployment health.
49. Integrate Lighthouse CI in the pipeline to track performance and accessibility budgets over time.
50. Automate changelog generation from conventional commits to streamline release notes.
51. Produce marketing copy for each flagship app and surface it in the portfolio's projects section.
52. Add storytelling content that contextualizes Kali Linux's role in ethical hacking and cybersecurity education.
53. Refresh the hero section of the public landing page with updated visuals and a concise value proposition.
54. Create case-study pages describing how different personas might use the simulated desktop environment.
55. Prepare a media kit with downloadable screenshots, logos, and brand guidelines for press outreach.
56. Draft a blog post series covering behind-the-scenes architecture decisions and technical learnings.
57. Build a mailing list signup module that integrates with a static-friendly provider via client-side API calls.
58. Design a release roadmap graphic that can be embedded on the site or shared externally.
59. Capture and document user feedback from playtests, synthesizing insights into actionable improvements.
60. Plan a community livestream event showcasing new features, complete with demo scripts and Q&A resources.
