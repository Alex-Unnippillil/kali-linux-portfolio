# Tab Sequence

The global keyboard navigation order is:

1. **Panel** – the top navigation bar.
2. **Dock** – the bottom taskbar.
3. **Desktop** – the main workspace with windows.

Skip links at the top of the page jump directly to these sections. Each section uses `tabindex="-1"` so focus moves correctly when a skip link is activated.
