# Navigation Guidelines

## Context Menu Submenus

- Submenus open to the right when there is sufficient horizontal space.
- When the submenu would overflow the viewport, it flips to the left and the caret points left.
- Submenus offset 4px from their trigger; the offset switches sides when flipped.

## Viewport Collision

- The root context menu repositions to remain fully visible within the viewport.
- Open submenus adjust vertically to avoid clipping at the top or bottom edges.
