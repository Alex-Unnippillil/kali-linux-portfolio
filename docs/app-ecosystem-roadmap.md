# App Ecosystem Roadmap

This roadmap consolidates the dynamic app registry and the open task backlog so the desktop shell, simulations, and games progress toward an "OS-ready" state. Update it whenever `apps.config.js` or `docs/tasks.md` changes so stakeholders can track ownership, dependencies, and status.

## Readiness Criteria for Every App

An app is considered **OS-ready** only when it satisfies these cross-cutting standards:

1. **UI polish** – responsive window layout, consistent launcher iconography, tuned default window sizes, and visual QA across light/dark wallpapers.
2. **Accessibility** – keyboard navigation, focus order, ARIA labeling, and high-contrast theming validated for both the desktop frame and the app’s internal UI.
3. **Offline behavior** – graceful fallbacks when network APIs or iframes fail, including demo data for simulators and cached assets for utilities/games.
4. **Telemetry & privacy** – analytics hooks emit structured events when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` is enabled while remaining silent otherwise. No unexpected network calls or stored secrets.

## Roadmap by Category

Each table groups the entries declared in `apps.config.js` and captures current implementation signals, suggested owners, and notable dependencies. Status values reflect whether `docs/tasks.md` still lists open work.

## Outstanding Feature Work by Category

- **Utilities & Productivity** – Implement calculator engine, YouTube history, QR camera picker, ASCII/Quote offline content, Resource Monitor metrics, Weather fake data, settings reset flow, Trash soft-delete metadata, HTTP/SSH builders, and contact form validation before claiming readiness.
- **Security Tool Simulators** – For every simulator, load canned outputs, provide safe command builders, surface "For lab use only" banners, and gate advanced flows behind the lab-mode flag to remain non-destructive.
- **Games & Interactive** – Build a shared canvas framework (loop, pause/reset, audio toggles, localStorage high scores) and apply it across all titles, prioritizing flagship experiences such as Tetris, 2048, and Space Invaders.

### OS-alignment To-Dos

1. **Permission prompts** – Normalize UX for media capture, clipboard access, and simulator lab toggles. Provide pre-flight dialogs and fallbacks for denied permissions.
2. **Shared settings** – Route wallpaper, theme, analytics, API keys, and lab-mode flags through a centralized settings store that utilities and simulators can read.
3. **Window defaults** – Audit each entry in `apps.config.js` for default/min size metadata to keep windows within the desktop grid and clear of dock/taskbar collisions.

## Living Checklist for Adding or Updating Apps

Use this checklist whenever a new app lands or an existing one gains major functionality:

1. **Registry update** – Add or adjust the dynamic app registration in `apps.config.js`, keeping alphabetical grouping and default window metadata tidy.
2. **Implementation** – Follow `docs/new-app-checklist.md` for icon placement, dynamic import pattern, CSP updates, and Playwright smoke coverage.
3. **Testing** – Extend Jest and Playwright suites for new behaviors (fixture-driven tests for simulators, loop helpers for games, form validation for utilities).
4. **Documentation** – Update this roadmap and `docs/tasks.md` with status, owner, and dependency changes. Capture any new env vars in `README.md`.
5. **OS readiness review** – Verify the readiness criteria (UI polish, accessibility, offline behavior, telemetry) before surfacing the app in launchers or marketing.

> _Keep this document synchronized with the codebase. When an app ships a milestone, flip its status to **Ready**, cite the supporting PR, and prune related TODOs in `docs/tasks.md`._
