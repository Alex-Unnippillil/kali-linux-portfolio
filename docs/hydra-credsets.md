# Hydra Credential Playbooks

The Hydra simulation now ships with a "Credential playbooks" panel for planning
red-team credential sprays without ever storing live secrets.

## Safe usage guidelines

- **Only log anonymized data.** Replace real usernames and passwords with role
  names, password composition patterns, or MFA notes.
- **Do not paste secrets.** The UI warns when clipboard data looks sensitive,
  but it will still store whatever you enter. Sanitize the text before saving.
- **Exported files are redacted.** JSON exports automatically mask secret-like
  strings and are intended for tabletop exercises or documentation.
- **Stay client-side.** Entries live in the browser using encrypted storage;
  clearing the browser data removes them.
- **Simulation only.** This feature documents hypothetical attack paths. Do not
  connect it to real infrastructure or use it to launch attacks.

## Disclaimers

The credential manager is an educational aid. It cannot guarantee that data you
enter is free of secretsâ€”review every record before saving or sharing exports.
Neither the maintainers nor contributors assume liability for misuse.
