# Keyboard-Only Window Management Test Plan

## Resizing
1. Open any window.
2. Focus the window.
3. Hold **Shift** and press arrow keys:
   - **Shift + ArrowRight** increases width.

   - **Shift + ArrowDown** increases height.
   - **Shift + ArrowUp** decreases height.
4. Verify the window resizes accordingly.

## Snapping

   - **Alt + ArrowLeft** snaps the window to the left half of the screen.
   - **Alt + ArrowRight** snaps it to the right half.
   - **Alt + ArrowUp** snaps it to the top half.
   - **Alt + ArrowDown** restores the window to its previous size and position.

## Focus
1. After resizing or snapping, press **Tab** to move focus inside the window.
2. Continue pressing **Tab** to confirm focus can leave the window and is not trapped.
3. Shift+Tab moves focus backward as expected.
