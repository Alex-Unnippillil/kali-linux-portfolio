# Client Logo Guidelines

To keep the client logo wall consistent and accessible:

- Provide logos as SVG or high-resolution PNG assets.
- Logos render in grayscale by default and reveal full color on hover.
- Maintain each logo's original aspect ratio. Set only the height and allow the width to scale automatically.
- Avoid stretching or distorting logos; whitespace trimming is acceptable but do not alter shapes.
- Ensure logos remain legible on small screens; the component limits logos to a 3rem height and uses a responsive grid.

Use the `ClientLogos` component to display grouped logos by industry or project type while honoring these guidelines.
