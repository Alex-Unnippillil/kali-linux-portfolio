# Contrast Checker

The style guide includes an interactive **Contrast Ratio Calculator** to help designers verify foreground and background color combinations.

1. Navigate to `/styleguide` in the application.
2. Use the color pickers to choose foreground and background colors.
3. The tool displays the WCAG contrast ratio and whether the pair meets AA (≥4.5:1) or AAA (≥7:1) requirements.
4. Pairs that fail AA are highlighted in red so they can be adjusted before use.

Use this widget to validate color choices before committing them to designs or code.
