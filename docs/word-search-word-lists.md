# Word Search word list sources

The built-in word packs bundled with the Word Search app are intentionally short and rely on openly licensed or self-curated content.

| Pack | Description | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Animals | Eight common animal names used for early vocabulary drills. | Curated by maintainers from elementary English classroom materials. |
| Fruits | Everyday fruit names that appear in the USDA “Kids’ Zone” nutrition activities (public domain). | USDA Food & Nutrition Service — Kids’ Zone printable activities. |
| Colors | Primary and secondary colors pulled from the W3C HTML color keyword list. | W3C HTML Living Standard. |
| Tech | Keywords that describe the project’s own stack and introductory programming topics. | Maintainer curated. |

Custom lists that users create are stored locally and marked as “User curated” in the pack metadata.
