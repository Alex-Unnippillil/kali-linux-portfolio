## Profile switcher exports

The profile switcher lets you back up the saved Bluetooth profiles captured by the BLE Sensor app. To export:

1. Open **BLE Sensor** from the desktop and locate the **Saved Profiles** section.
2. Choose **Export Profiles** and provide a password when prompted. The download is an encrypted JSON file that embeds version metadata so future imports can detect compatibility.
3. Keep the password safeâ€”imports require the same password and the checksum guard rejects altered files.

To restore, pick **Import Profiles**, select the exported file, and enter the password. Valid exports repopulate the switcher and notify other open tabs via the broadcast channel.
