Pseudo-code for createPubSub function (from utils/pubsub.ts):

1. Initialize an empty map named `channels` to hold topics and their subscribers.
2. Provide a `publish(topic, data)` method:
   a. Retrieve the set of callbacks `subs` for the given `topic` from `channels`.
   b. If `subs` exists, invoke each callback with `data`.
3. Provide a `subscribe(topic, cb)` method:
   a. Retrieve the set `subs` for the `topic` from `channels`.
   b. If no set exists, create a new empty set and store it in `channels` for the `topic`.
   c. Add the callback `cb` to `subs`.
   d. Return a function that, when called, removes `cb` from `subs`.
4. Return an object containing the `publish` and `subscribe` methods.
