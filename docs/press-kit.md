### Short Bio (\~50 words)
Alex Unnippillil is a full-stack developer and security enthusiast who created the Kali Linux Portfolio—a browser-based desktop that mimics a Kali/Ubuntu interface. The project showcases safe simulations of popular security utilities alongside classic games, blending education and nostalgia.

### Medium Bio (\~100 words)
Alex Unnippillil is a developer focused on demystifying cybersecurity through approachable software. His Kali Linux Portfolio reimagines the Kali desktop in the browser with draggable windows, a dock, and a catalog of security-tool simulations that are strictly non-operational. The site doubles as an arcade, featuring retro titles and gamepad support. Alex shares his work openly, encouraging learners to explore defensive and offensive concepts in a safe environment while enjoying modern web capabilities such as PWAs and offline caching.

### Long Bio (\~200 words)
Alex Unnippillil is a full-stack engineer with a passion for making security concepts accessible. Drawing on years of tinkering with penetration-testing distributions, he built the Kali Linux Portfolio to resemble a familiar desktop environment where curious minds can poke around without risk. Each simulated tool— from Nmap to Wireshark—renders canned output and interactive interfaces, guiding visitors through typical workflows while emphasizing legal and ethical boundaries. Beyond security demonstrations, the portfolio hosts a growing library of mini-games, multimedia experiments, and utilities that showcase the flexibility of modern web APIs. Alex aims to bridge the gap between curiosity and capability by delivering technical depth through approachable design, giving educators and newcomers a safe space to learn.

## Sample Q&A

**Q:** What is the goal of the Kali Linux Portfolio?

**A:** To offer a safe, educational environment where visitors can explore simulated security tools and enjoy retro games inside a web-based Kali-style desktop.

**Q:** Can the tools execute real attacks?

**A:** No. All tools are client-side simulations that use canned data. They are intended strictly for learning and demonstration.

**Q:** How can others contribute?

**A:** Contributions are welcome via GitHub. Bug reports, feature ideas, and pull requests help grow the catalog of simulations and games.

## Notable Highlights

- 20+ security-tool simulations with interactive UIs.
