# Hashcat Advisor Guidelines

The Hashcat simulation now includes a strategy advisor that reacts to user input without offering operational instructions. This note explains how to extend the tips safely.

## Adding a new tip

1. Open `components/apps/hashcat/Advisor.tsx`.
2. Add a new entry to the exported `advisorRules` array.
   - Give it a unique `id`.
   - Provide localization-ready copy via the `message` object (`id` and `defaultMessage`).
   - Set `tone` to either `info` or `caution` to pick the badge style.
   - Supply a `test` function that inspects the `AdvisorContext` and returns `true` when the tip should appear.
3. Update `__tests__/hashcat-advisor.test.tsx` with a matching context in the `rule coverage` test so every rule stays exercised.
4. Run `yarn test hashcat-advisor` to confirm the advisor suite passes.

## Guard rails

- Keep every tip non-prescriptive. Focus on what the simulation is demonstrating (e.g., why adaptive hashes are slow) rather than how to run a live attack.
- Do not link to tooling that enables offensive action. Point to existing documentation that is already surfaced in the UI if needed.
- Avoid suggesting targets, infrastructure, or evasion strategies.
- If you add analytics tracking properties, stick to high-level metadata (like which rule fired) so no sensitive input leaves the browser.

Following these guard rails keeps the demo aligned with the projectâ€™s "education only" policy while still giving visitors useful talking points.
