# Hangman Word List Sources

The refreshed Hangman app uses curated vocabularies that align with the portfolio's security-and-technology theme while keeping a few approachable categories for casual play. Each list was derived from public resources that provide terminology summaries or glossaries. Words were normalized to lowercase ASCII so the in-app renderer can draw them cleanly.

| Category | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| animals | [Smithsonian’s National Zoo animal index](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/list) | Chosen for recognisable species that span short and medium word lengths. |
| geography | [USGS glossary of landform terms](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/landform-glossary) | Focused on terrain features that appear in introductory geography material. |
| mythology | [Encyclopædia Britannica mythology entries](https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-myths) | Mix of Greco-Roman, Norse, Egyptian, and Mesoamerican figures to keep the list global. |
| cybersecurity | [CISA cybersecurity glossary](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cisa-cybersecurity-glossary) | Selected practitioner terminology without punctuation so each entry remains a single Hangman target. |
| technology | [ACM Computing Curriculum glossary](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/3291279) | Core computing concepts and tooling vocabulary used in undergraduate survey courses. |

Additional legacy sets (family, movie quotes, SAT vocabulary) remain intact to preserve backward compatibility with saved games and shared URLs.
