# Deauthentication Attack Mitigation

Deauthentication floods send forged management frames to disconnect wireless clients. Mitigate this threat by:

- Enabling **802.11w Management Frame Protection** so that deauth frames are authenticated.
- Monitoring for excessive deauthentication traffic and alerting on anomalies.
- Using strong encryption (WPA2/WPA3) and rotating keys regularly.
- Limiting access-point exposure and segmenting networks.
