# Clipboard Manager

## Purpose
Implements the Clipboard Manager utility that powers the desktop tile and the direct /apps route. Stores the static web assets that back the clipboard manager share-target prototype.

## Entry Points
- `index.html` — Static prototype bundled with the repository for reference.
- `apps.config.js` — registers the `clipboard-manager` tile so the desktop launcher opens the shared window component.

## Local Development
1. `yarn dev`
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` and launch the app from the desktop grid.
