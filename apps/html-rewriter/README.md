# Html Rewriter

## Purpose
Implements the Html Rewriter utility that powers the desktop tile and the direct /apps route. Implements the HTML rewriting playground with diff preview and sanitisation helpers.

## Entry Points
- `index.tsx` — React entry point that renders the standalone experience.
- `apps.config.js` — registers the `html-rewriter` tile so the desktop launcher opens the shared window component.

## Local Development
1. `yarn dev`
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` and launch the app from the desktop grid.
