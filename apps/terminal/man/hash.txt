HASH
    Simulate a CPU-intensive hashing run without blocking the UI.

SYNOPSIS
    hash <text>
    <command> | hash

DESCRIPTION
    Runs a fake hashing routine inside a Web Worker. The worker performs
    heavy computation in chunks and streams progress back to the terminal,
    demonstrating how long-running tasks can stay responsive.

EXAMPLES
    hash secret
    cat payload.txt | hash
