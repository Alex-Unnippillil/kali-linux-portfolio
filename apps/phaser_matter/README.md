# Phaser + Matter Demo

## Purpose
Provides the standalone view for the Phaser + Matter Demo mini-game so it can run full-screen as well as inside the desktop window manager. Demonstrates Phaser with Matter.js physics for arcade experiments.

## Entry Points
- `index.tsx` — React entry point that renders the standalone experience.
- `pages/apps/phaser_matter.jsx` — Next.js wrapper that dynamically imports this folder for the `/apps/phaser_matter` route.

## Local Development
1. `yarn dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/apps/phaser_matter` or open the “Phaser + Matter Demo” tile from the app grid.
