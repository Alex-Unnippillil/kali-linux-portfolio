# Metasploit Post

## Purpose
Hosts the full-screen simulation of Metasploit Post, keeping the demo strictly educational while mirroring the desktop window experience. Focuses on post-exploitation checklists, issue tracking samples, and privilege escalation guides.

## Entry Points
- `index.tsx` — React entry point that renders the standalone experience.
- `pages/apps/metasploit-post.jsx` — Next.js wrapper that dynamically imports this folder for the `/apps/metasploit-post` route.

## Local Development
1. `yarn dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/apps/metasploit-post` or open the “Metasploit Post” tile from the app grid.
