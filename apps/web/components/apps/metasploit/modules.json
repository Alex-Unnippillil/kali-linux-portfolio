The attacker\n          must successfully know, or guess, the target's internal gateway IP address.\n          This is usually a default value of 192.168.0.1.\n\n          First, a hardcoded backdoor account was discovered in the source code\n          of one device with the credentials \"technician/yZgO8Bvj\". Due to lack of CSRF\n          in the device's login form, these credentials - along with the default\n          \"admin/motorola\" - can be sent to the device by an arbitrary website, thus\n          inadvertently logging the user into the router.\n\n          Once successfully logged in, a persistent XSS vulnerability is\n          exploited in the firewall configuration page.

Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection.\n          If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising.\n\n          In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP\n          Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended\n          in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report\n          identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application -\n          processing any file in the web application as a JSP. Further, if the web application allowed file upload\n          and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the\n          web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made\n          remote code execution possible.\n\n          It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users.\n          Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files\n          and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were\n          made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration.\n          It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes\n          to their configurations.",

By sending a specially crafted election\n          request, an attacker can cause a pool overflow.\n\n          The vulnerability appears to be due to an error handling a length value\n          while calculating the amount of memory to copy to a buffer. When there are\n          zero bytes left in the buffer, the length value is improperly decremented\n          and an integer underflow occurs. The resulting value is used in several\n          calculations and is then passed as the length value to an inline memcpy\n          operation.\n\n          Unfortunately, the length value appears to be fixed at -2 (0xfffffffe) and\n          causes considerable damage to kernel heap memory. While theoretically possible,\n          it does not appear to be trivial to turn this vulnerability into remote (or\n          even local) code execution.",

There is a strange timing requirement where the `download` (or first) request must get\n          to the server first, but the `upload` (or second) request must be very close behind it.\n          From testing against the docker image, it was found values between `.01` and `1.9` were\n          viable.

This properties file contains an encrypted password that is set during\n          installation. What is interesting about this password is that it is set as the same password\n          as the database 'sa' user and of the admin user created during installation. This password\n          is encrypted with a static key, and is encrypted using a weak cipher (ECB). By default,\n          if installed with a local SQL Server instance, the SQL Server is listening on all interfaces.\n\n          Recovering this password allows an attacker to potentially authenticate as the 'sa' SQL Server\n          user in order to achieve remote command execution with permissions of the database process. If\n          the administrator has not changed the password for the initially created account since installation,\n          the attacker will have the password for this account. By default, 'admin' is recommended.\n\n          Any user account can be used to exploit this, all that is needed is a valid credential.\n\n          The most data that can be successfully retrieved is 255 characters due to length restrictions\n          on the field used to perform the XXE attack.",
