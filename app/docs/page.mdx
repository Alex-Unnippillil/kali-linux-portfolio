# Kali Linux Portfolio documentation

Explore detailed manuals for the simulated desktop applications that power this project. Each guide is rendered on the server and written in MDX so it stays fast, accessible, and easy to maintain alongside the codebase.

## Getting started

This documentation hub focuses on the portfolio's interactive experiences. Use the quick links below to jump into the topics that matter most while you are exploring the desktop environment.

- [Terminal app manual](/docs/terminal)
- Desktop tour (coming soon)
- Simulation design guidelines (coming soon)

If you are contributing to the project, review the repository `README` for setup commands, coding standards, and QA expectations. These MDX pages complement those instructions with app-specific workflows and guardrails.

## Feedback

Found something confusing or spotted a behaviour that needs clarification? Open an issue on GitHub with screenshots and the steps you tried, or reach out through the contact form inside the desktop experience. Documentation updates are shipped alongside code changes so improvements arrive quickly.
