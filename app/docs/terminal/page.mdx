# Terminal application

The terminal is a browser-based simulation of a Kali Linux command line. This documentation is rendered server-side using MDX so
it stays in sync with the code that powers the experience. Use it as a quick-reference when presenting the portfolio or when
contributing new terminal features.

## Launching and layout

Open the **Terminal** from the desktop application grid or via the search launcher. The window uses the shared `TabbedWindow`
component, so you can spawn parallel sessions with the **New tab** control. Each tab hosts an isolated terminal instance with its
own history and worker context.

The toolbar above the terminal surface exposes clipboard and theme tools:

- **Copy** mirrors the service worker helper and sends the current buffer to the clipboard.
- **Paste** reads text from the clipboard and feeds it directly into the active prompt.
- **Settings** previews the ANSI colour palette and common file listings used by the terminal theme.

## Built-in commands

Type `help` after the welcome banner to print the registry of built-in commands. The simulation ships with helpers that mirror
a small subset of common GNU/Linux utilities:

- `history` prints the commands you have executed in the current tab.
- `alias` lets you inspect or create temporary aliases for longer commands.
- `man <command>` streams a markdown manual page for `alias`, `cat`, `grep`, `history`, `jq`, or `man` itself.
- `ls` lists the demo files exposed to the terminal sandbox.
- `cat`, `grep`, and `jq` delegate to a dedicated Web Worker so longer-running examples do not block the UI.
- `open <app>` dispatches a request to the desktop manager so you can launch another application without leaving the terminal.
- `clear` wipes the screen and removes the persisted `history.txt` file if offline storage is available.
- `date` and `about` echo contextual information used in demos and walkthroughs.

All commands execute locally inside the browserâ€”no real system calls are made and no network requests leave the page.

## Productivity shortcuts

The terminal integrates a set of keyboard-driven workflows to keep demos fast:

- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` toggles the command palette. Start typing to filter the registry and press `Enter` to run the selection.
- `Tab` autocompletes against known commands and prints matches when multiple options exist.
- `Ctrl` + `F` opens an inline search across the current buffer using the xterm.js search add-on.
- `Ctrl` + `R` performs a reverse search through the in-memory command history, mirroring common shell behaviour.

A subtle gradient at the top and bottom of the viewport indicates when additional output is available for scrolling.

## Persistence and storage

When the browser exposes the Origin Private File System (OPFS), the terminal stores its running transcript in
`history.txt`. Reloading or reopening a tab restores that content so long-form demos can pick up where they left off. Running
`clear` removes both the visible output and the stored file.

## Limitations

This app intentionally avoids executing arbitrary binaries or shell scripts. Heavy lifting happens in Web Workers and static
JSON assets so the experience remains deterministic and safe for workshops. Use these docs when you need to describe the
simulation to viewers or to confirm behaviours before adding new commands.
