# Kali Terminal overview

Welcome to the **simulated terminal**. This guide explains the goals of the demo app and how to explore its features without running real commands.

## Getting started

1. Launch the Terminal app from the dock or applications menu.
2. Use the help prompt to see a list of supported commands.
3. Remember that all commands are sandboxed for educational purposes.

## Built-in commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `help` | Lists the supported demo commands. |
| `clear` | Clears the terminal output pane. |
| `scan` | Shows a mock vulnerability scan report. |

### Tips

- Combine commands with flags to explore additional canned output.
- Resize the window or toggle fullscreen to read large reports comfortably.
- Visit other docs under `/docs` for deeper walkthroughs of each simulated tool.
